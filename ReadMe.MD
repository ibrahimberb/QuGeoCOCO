# QuGeoCOCO

QuGeoCOCO is a Python tool that streamlines the process of 
converting GeoJSON outputs from QuPath into JSON files compatible 
with the COCO format. 

QuPath, a widely 
used software for digital pathology analysis, generates annotation results 
in GeoJSON format, which may not directly suit certain applications. 
By leveraging QuGeoCOCO, users can seamlessly transform these GeoJSON 
outputs into a format that adheres to the COCO standard. 

This conversion enables smoother integration of QuPath's pathology 
analysis results with various computer vision and machine learning pipelines 
designed to work with COCO-style annotations. 

Ultimately, QuGeoCOCO serves as a valuable bridge between QuPath and COCO, 
enhancing the interoperability of pathology data within broader image analysis 
workflows.
